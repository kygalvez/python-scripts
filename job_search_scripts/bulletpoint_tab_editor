# I created a script that will delete bullet points and replace \t (tab space) with a space.
# The parsed information from my resume on an application tracking system added tabs rather than spaces in between 
# words. Rather than replacing tabs and removing bullet points manually, I created a script that did so from parsed 
# information that is copied to the clipboard and returns an aesthetically pleasing result back to the clipboard.

for i in range(len(bullet_points)):  # loop through all the indexes
    bullet_points[i] = bullet_points[i].translate(str.maketrans("\t", " ", "â€¢ "))  # Replace tab with space and removes 
    # bullet points
